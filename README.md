DESCRIPTION
This app allows students to create a bookshelf of books they are reading, and map out a timeline of events that occurred in the text.  Students will be able to view multiple saved timelines, allowing them to draw connections between different books.  Offering a visual and interactive way to engage with text will help bring deeper understanding and fun to the world of reading!
